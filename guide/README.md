#Intro to Cydia Development

A guide I have been wanting to finish over the past few months. I recently posted on reddit about the possibility of me writing one, and there was high demand. This is NOT targeting the people who have never touched the command line and is definitely not an introduction to Objective-C.

The post was written in Markdown so it would be easier for more people to contribute.
